# Unity on Docker on CodeSpaces

Gone are the days when we were deprived of freedom of expression due to differences in our environment.  
We can now use Unity freely.

Let's have fun and express ourselves to the fullest.

## Install Unity Editor

```powershell
unityhub --headless install --version 2021.3.15f1 --module documentation standardassets language-ja --no-sandbox
```
